*Tamelang* is an embedded DSL for Python to define programs in other programming language.
Tamelang is a metalanguage backed by a clean, typed API to define an object-oriented model
of a program, which can then be transpiled/compiled to a supported target language.

Tamelang is designed with the following goals in mind:

- Use Python as a host language to define programs and meta-programs. Similar to Lisp,
  or Zig's `comptime`, there is little difference between code and code-generating code.

Tamelang is the spiritual successor to [Î»-factory](https://github.com/sebastien/lambdafactory),
a toolkit to easily plug syntactic front-ends with transpiling backends.
